	How do I have to change?
	Do you think it's not enough?
	I gave it all
	What have I got to do
	to make myself be chosen?
	No second thoughs for me
	Just wanna be a man or a hero
	Unconsciously I wonder how
	to be The Special
	Dive into the depth of my heart
	Find
	myself feeling childish fears
	The invisible hand of God
	Had made us burst
	their ancient locks
	And now, the world
	I trusted breaks apart
	at the seams
	Gotta burn my pride
	We'll take a chance to make them
	crystallize
	No one knows our beasts inside
	will be the demons or the saints
	Never doubt myself
	Show me your justice,
	cuz you realize
	So long now, my friend
	Have a brighter day tomorrow

	How do I have to change?
	Small things
	will bring and begin big impacts
	His paper castle's gone
	Entire ground's
	still been frozen
	Slipped into evil's sway,
	he kept on building the lies
	and fictions
	We all got lost within ourselves
	what we should believe in
	Dive into the depth of my heart
	Find
	myself feeling childish fears
	The invisible hand of God
	Had made us burst
	their ancient locks
	And now, the world
	I trusted breaks apart
	at the seams
	Gotta burn my pride
	We'll take a chance to make them
	crystallize
	No one knows our beasts inside
	will be the demons or the saints
	Never doubt myself
	Show me your justice,
	cuz you realize
	So long now, my friend
	Have a brighter day tomorrow
	Thousand tears
	call the shadow of the nightmare
	Thousand years past,
	longing for the future
	Thousand grief shed
	cruelty and their blood but
	Thousand beliefs will
	salvage our souls
	Gotta light my pride
	We'll take a chance to make them
	crystallize
	No one knows our beasts inside
	will be the demons or the saints
	Never doubt myself
	Show me your justice,
	cuz you realize
	So long now, my friend
	Have a brighter day tomorrow
	Thousand tears
	call the shadow of the nightmare
	Thousand years past,
	longing for the future
	Thousand grief shed
	cruelty and their blood but
	Thousand beliefs will
	salvage our souls
